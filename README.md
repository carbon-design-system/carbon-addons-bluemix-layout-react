# carbon-addons-catalog-react

The React version of carbon-addons-catalog (currently the only version).

## Usage

`npm install -S carbon-addons-catalog-react`

Make sure to include the Sass files in your own build - currently the Sass files require that you have an `includePaths` configuration in your Sass build to include the `node_modules` folder (which makes 'carbon-components/scss/....' resolve appropriately)
